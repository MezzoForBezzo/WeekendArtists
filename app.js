With moas they are among our most ancient birds and have probably been present in New Zealand since before the end of the Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago, after which time connections with large land masses beyond New Zealand ceased to exist. Both kiwis and moas are Ratite birds – possessing no keel on the breastbone, or sternum, and are unable to fly. No extinct species of kiwi is known. The three recent species are: the common kiwi, Apteryx australis, with three races, one each in North, South, and Stewart Islands; the little spotted kiwi, A. oweni, now found along the whole of the western side of the South Island; and the great spotted kiwi, A. haasti, which occurs from western Nelson to about mid-Westland.","content_partner":["Ministry for Culture and Heritage"],"category":["Articles"],"creator":[],"dc_type":[],"dnz_type":"Reference","date":[],"source_url":"http://api.digitalnz.org/records/31897649/source","collection":["Ministry for Culture and Heritage"],"alternate_title":[],"additional_description":[],"display_content_partner":"Ministry for Culture and Heritage","collection_title":["Ministry for Culture and Heritage"],"display_collection":"The Encyclopedia of New Zealand 1966","primary_collection":["The Encyclopedia of New Zealand 1966"],"contributing_partner":["The Encyclopedia of New Zealand 1966"],"contributor":["Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand"],"copyright":[],"citation":[],"credit_creator":null,"language":["en"],"provenance":null,"publisher":["Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga","R.E.

Reed Ltd. had been a successful independent NZ book publisher since 1907, and in late 1957 they launched a record label, Kiwi (often called Kiwi Pacific), to complement their printed work. The idea was that they would combine books and records to create unique and attractive packages, focusing strongly on Māori music and the educational market. A.H. & A.W. Reed hired Tony Vercoe to run the label in 1959.
